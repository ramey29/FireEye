# Project FireEye
You need to have npm and gulp installed and run them, once done you can open the FireEye Project.

Run this Command:

npm install

gulp

You can even run manually, if you dont want to run gulp setup, by opening index.html in browser directly.

Have used Twitter widget to get the two peoples timeline.You can tweet to one user only if you are logged in.

Apart from that the project has capabilities of Browser Sync, concatenation, minification of js, minification of css, image minification and run sequence which will take care of all your project development needs dynamically.
And at the end there will be 'dist' folder created which could be used to deploy on any sever.

I have added to API (both are Tech Radar) as User 1 and User 2 and way to add Tweet to User 2 , Though it adds things like Tweet dynamically , The username and image is static.
